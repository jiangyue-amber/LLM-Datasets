2.  ✅ The description provides enough information to understand the core functionality: analyzing income and expenses to provide financial insights and suggestions. This covers the essential elements.

3.  ❌ The description does not explicitly state that the software does not require internet access. While it *could* be self-contained, the description doesn't guarantee this.
