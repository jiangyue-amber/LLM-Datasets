Gemini's Evaluation:
Here's the evaluation of the Language_Grammar_Quiz software against the provided rules:

1.  ✅ The primary function, providing grammar quizzes, is simple, common, and feasible to implement. It involves generating questions, accepting answers, and providing feedback, all of which are standard programming tasks.

2.  ✅ The description covers the essential information needed to define the core functionality. It mentions the quiz format (multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank), grammatical aspects covered, language selection, difficulty levels, and feedback. This provides a solid overview of what the software does.

3.  ✅ The description doesn't mention any requirement for internet access, and the functionality (generating and grading grammar quizzes) can easily be achieved offline. Thus, the software inherently appears self-contained.

4.  ✅ The software can be realized without real-world data sources. The grammatical rules and sample sentences can be pre-programmed or generated algorithmically, without needing to pull data from external sources.

5.  ✅ The description implies single-user operation. The user selects language and difficulty and receives feedback on their own answers. It is unlike online chat software that requires multiple users.
