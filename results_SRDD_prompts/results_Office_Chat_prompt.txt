Gemini's Evaluation:
Here's an evaluation of Office_Chat against the provided design rules:

1.  ✅ The primary function is real-time communication within an office, encompassing message sending, file sharing, and collaboration. This is a simple, common, and feasible function for a software application.

2.  ✅ The description effectively covers the essential information: real-time communication, employees within an office, messaging, file sharing, collaboration, and specific features like group chats, file sharing, search, and notifications. This description accurately reflects the core functionality.

3.  ❌ The description does *not* explicitly state that the software doesn't require internet access. While an "office chat" *could* be designed to be self-contained, this isn't guaranteed by the current description. The description lacks this critical piece of information.

4.  ✅ The described software can be realized without real-world data sources. It primarily involves internal communication and file sharing. No external feeds or live data are necessary for its core functionality.

5.  ✅ While designed for an office, a single user *can* still test the basic functionality such as sending messages to themselves, sharing files, and exploring settings. The software's core features do not *require* multiple users to function.
