Gemini's Evaluation:
Here's the evaluation of Speed_Shift against the five design rules:

1.  ✅ Speed Shift's primary function is providing a simulated racing experience, which is a simple, common, and feasible concept for game development.

2.  ✅ The description adequately captures the core functionality: racing high-performance vehicles, strategically shifting gears, and navigating challenging tracks. It describes the racing focus and the key mechanic (shifting) needed for gameplay.

3.  ✅ Speed Shift, based on the description, doesn't inherently require internet access. It's a self-contained racing game experience.

4.  ✅ The game can be realized without real-world data. The tracks, cars, and physics can be simulated or artistically created, rather than based on real-world data sources.

5.  ✅ The description implies single-player operability. Racing games are typically designed for a single player, and the description doesn't suggest any multi-user testing requirements.
